### Project topic: 
Learning Data Analysis at Incubator hub.
--------

### Project overview
--------
This shows my learning progress in Data Analysis at the Incubator Hub which enable me to learn how to use some tools to clean, analyse,visualise Data.

### Data Sources
-------
The primary source of Data is gotten from our Facilitators which they outsourced from kaggle and any other data repository site.

### Tools used
------------
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](http://www.microsoft.com)
   1. For Data cleaning
   2. for Analysis
   3. for Visualisation
- SQL- Structured Query Language for querying Data.
- Github for Portfolio Building.
- Power BI- Power Business Intelligence for Data Visualisation.

  ### Data cleaning and preparation
  -------
  In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation,we perorm the following actions:
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling misssing variable
  3. Data cleaning and formatting
     
  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
   ----------
  We use the exploratory data to answer some questions about Data such as:
    - Which products are top seller?
    - What are the products on peak sale?
    - What is the overall sales trend?

   ### Data Analysis
  -------
    This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expression used during analysis:

 ```SQL
  CREATE database LITA_DB
  ```
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Employee (
staffid varchar (10) not null,
FirstName varchar (255) NOT NULL,
SecondName varchar (255),
Gender varchar (10),

```SOL
SELECT * from Employee
````
